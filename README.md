# Xint
[Xint](https://xint.pages.dev) is a webapp that allows you to read and manage EPUB ebooks.
I created Xint because of my frustrations with the currently available options for reading EPUB ebooks.

## Current features
* can read EPUB files
* can save and delete EPUB files
* works offline
* works on mobile and desktop
* displays ToC as well as `spine`
* displays images

## What makes Xint different from other apps
* saves files into your browser, your ebooks are not sent to the server

## Planned features
* support for other ebook formats
* splitting content into real pages
* ability to export PDF
* ability to export Kindle formats
* ability to take screenshots
* allow metadata editing
