# [Xint](https://xint.pages.dev)
Xint is a webapp that allows you to read and manage EPUB ebooks.
I created Xint because of my frustrations with the currently available options for reading ebooks on mobile and desktop.
I wanted to create an app that is blazingly fast, has a clean interface and works on all major platforms.

You can use Xint here: [xint.pages.dev](https://xint.pages.dev)
